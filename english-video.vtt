00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.600
We hope you will enjoy
the following ranking.

2
00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:04.243
Please let us know your favorite

3
00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.760
in the comments and make sure to subscribe
to never miss a good movie again.

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.600
Number 5.

5
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.080
Don't expect your family
to understand what you're doing.

6
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.360
You just don't et hope they'll accept it.

7
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.560
I'm so excited for you, man.

8
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.820
You're going to be a good dad.

9
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.840
And when you get home, you hope you
can pick up right where you left off.

10
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.880
Three, two, one.
All clear.

11
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:42.920
Target secure.

12
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.960
This is a personnel recovery.

13
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.600
Proceed to target, recover the package,
and move to extract.

14
00:00:49.630 --> 00:01:04.880
Got it.

15
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.200
Target secure.

16
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.760
Man, I'm taking it home.

17
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.020
For all those who've been down range,
it's us and those like us.

18
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.840
Damn few.

19
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.660
I have positive control of the Raven.

20
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.680
We have enemy QRF
approaching from the north.

21
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.740
This thing is way bigger
than we thought it was.

22
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.800
We're going to need this at home.

23
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.280
Hey, boys, we got a roll.

24
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.980
Just for a minute.

25
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.560
The Silver Fort Sky.

26
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.180
Two layers to move on target Alpha.

27
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.060
All boots are on the ground.

28
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.760
Be safe.

29
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:55.540
How can you stop this?

30
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.240
I can't.

31
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.640
You live your life by a code.

32
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.200
It's your shoreline.

33
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.100
It's what guides you home.

34
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:15.280
And trust me,
you're always trying to get home.

35
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.600
Number
4. I

36
00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.640
got a military age male on the cell
phone watching the convoy.

37
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.020
Over.

38
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.460
If you think he's reporting troop
movement, you have a green light.

39
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.720
Your call, over.

40
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.120
Maybe he's just calling his old lady.

41
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.720
He stepped off.

42
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.520
Hold on.

43
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:32.560
I got a woman and a kid 200 yards out,
moving towards the convoy.

44
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.280
Her arms aren't swinging.

45
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.360
She's carrying something.

46
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.160
Yeah, she's got a granate.

47
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.240
She's got an RKG Russian granate.

48
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.720
She's saying to the kid.

49
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.580
You say a woman and a kid?

50
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.320
You got eyes on this?

51
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.360
Can you confirm?
Negative.

52
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.200
Your call.

53
00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:14.560
May fry you if you're wrong.

54
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.080
Number three.

55
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.320
Following is a state secret, gentlemen.

56
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.080
Disclose it to any party and you
will be subject to prosecution.

57
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.680
His name is John Mason,

58
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:38.420
British National Incarcerated
on Alcatraz in 1962, escaped in '63.

59
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.400
There's no identity in the
United States or Green Britain.

60
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.600
He does not exist.

61
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.960
Secrets have a way of coming
back to haunt you.

62
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.680
There's a hostage situation on Alcatraz.

63
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:53.800
How strange.

64
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.220
81 tourists.

65
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.340
The rocks are tourist attraction.

66
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.000
The one you train to defend you
becomes your greatest threat.

67
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.000
The battery of VX gas rockets is presently
deployed to deliver a highly lethal strike

68
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.800
on the population of the
San Francisco Bay Area.

69
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.560
And the one you abandon
becomes your only hope.

70
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.480
You go talk to him.
Me?

71
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.420
Yeah.
Hi, there.

72
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.460
I'm an agent with the FBI.

73
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.820
I'm Stanley Goodsby.

74
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.360
But of course, you are.

75
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.360
At least he got his name right.

76
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.440
Now, all that stands between
a city and a disaster.

77
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.360
The power of this chemical is way
beyond anything you can imagine.

78
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.320
That's why you're coming with us.

79
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.320
Is a man who's never seen combat...

80
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.840
You're a chemical freak.

81
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.520
I'm a chemical super freak, actually.

82
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.960
And another who's been out
of action for 30 years.

83
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.060
Show us some of the blueprints.
I can't.

84
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.600
My blueprint was in my head.

85
00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.140
Fortunately, some things
you'll never forget.

86
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:56.360
But don't worry,
it'll all come back to me.

87
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.800
From Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer,

88
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:09.040
the producers of Top Gun and Crimson Tire,
and Michael Bay, the director of Bad Boys.

89
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.040
Welcome to the Rock.

90
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.320
We got visitors.

91
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:13.360
Sean Connery.

92
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.140
You sure you're ready for this?

93
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.160
I'll do my best.

94
00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.940
Your best?

95
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.740
Losers always whine about their best.

96
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.200
Nicholas Cage.

97
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.600
Listen, I'm just a bio chemist.

98
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.460
I drive a Volvo.
Beige one.

99
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.720
What do you say you cut
me some freaking slack?

100
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:58.660
Ed Harris, fire. This summer,

101
00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.120
get ready to rock.

102
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.840
Number 2.

103
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.160
Can I be honest with you?

104
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.160
I am bad news.

105
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.560
I'm not your friend.

106
00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.680
I'm not going to help you.

107
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.160
I'm going to break you.

108
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.520
Any questions?

109
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.920
I want to make something absolutely clear.

110
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:48.080
If you thought there was some
working group coming to the rescue,

111
00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:56.800
and I want you to know that you're wrong,
this is it.

112
00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.820
There's nobody else hidden
away on some other floor.

113
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:03.760
There is just us.

114
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.720
And we are failing.

115
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.840
You really believe this story?

116
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:22.240
Osama bin laden?
Yeah.

117
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.740
What part convinced you?

118
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.920
Her confidence.

119
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:36.680
If you're right, the whole world
is going to win in on this.

120
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.480
You will never find him.

121
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.040
He is one of the disappeared

122
00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:04.080
ones. number 1.

123
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.860
I'm a petty officer, Shane.

124
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.200
What can he say?
Can you say it?

125
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.700
Mr.
Patten, please.

126
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.520
Come on.
Been around the world twice.

127
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:15.820
Talked to everyone once.

128
00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:17.560
There ain't nothing I can't do.

129
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.320
No sky too high, no sea too rough.

130
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.280
I learned a lot of lessons in my life.

131
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:24.440
Never shoot a large caliber man
with a small caliber bullet.
